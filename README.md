# Precision-Recall-F1-Score-

This project is a Python implementation of Precision, Recall, and F1 Score metrics, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of binary classification models.


Precision is one indicator of a machine learning model's performance â€“ the quality of a positive prediction made by the model. Precision refers to the number of true positives divided by the total number of positive predictions (i.e., the number of true positives plus the number of false positives).


The recall is calculated as the ratio between the number of Positive samples correctly classified as Positive to the total number of Positive samples. The recall measures the model's ability to detect Positive samples. The higher the recall, the more positive samples detected.


F1 score is a machine learning evaluation metric that measures a model's accuracy. It combines the precision and recall scores of a model. The accuracy metric computes how many times a model made a correct prediction across the entire dataset.
